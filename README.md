A web application designed for iPads and used to collect sales leads while on tour. The user is guided through a list of selectable items representing the "mobile classroom experience" by one of the team members, and contact information is then collected. This data is ultimately HTTP POSTed to our Salesforce CRM where it can be later utilized.
